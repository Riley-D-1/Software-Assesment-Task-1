### Task Definition:Objective


The objective of my program is to enable users to view NASA data (https://api.nasa.gov/), allowing easier access to space data and allowing space enthusiasts to interact with the wide variety of data supplied. My program allows users to see the Astronomy Picture of the day (APOD) and query Near Earth Object Web Service(NeoWs). The APOD is a fun snapshot that highlights the breathtaking astronomy photography of others which highlights an astronomical idea or event and it builds public interest in space. NeoWs gives real time extensive data about the hundreds of objects that wizz past our earth every week. The program aims to give users information about space and in particular asteroids. It caters to those with an interest in space and who are wanting to learn more.


### Functional Requirements (What the system should do)


- Users must be able to request an Astronomy Picture of the day and/or Near Earth Object Web Service. It would allow users to see the all of the asteroids in a table with a the results of each, the size  and  and a graph for the number of notifications a day
- Users must be able to see the history of the requests made with the program
- Users must be able to retrieve NASA data that is displayed in a logical and simple way in the user interface.
- The app must allow users to look for specific data using the program.


### Non functional requirements
- The system should be responsive and complete all actions within 5 seconds.
- The system should be available 98% of the time.
- It needs to be intuitive and simple to navigate to a basic internet user.
- It should detect user errors such as spelling or unexpected inputs or not allow user errors in the first place. It should account for the use of upper- and lower-case characters. It should handle errors and exceptions gracefully and prevent run-time errors.
- The system should work on a wide variety of Windows devices.
## Specifications
### Functional Specifications
### User Requirements
- The user needs to be able enter different parameters to adjust the results of the program.
- Users need to be able to request Astronomy Picture of the day and Near Earth Object Web Service.
- Users need to be able to see the history of the requests made with the program and be able to clear their history.
### Inputs & Outputs
- The system needs to be able to accept user inputs and will need to display information from the NASA API in a logical way through a GUI. This will include graphs, images, text and tables.
### Core Features
- At the program's core it needs Astronomy picture of the day (APOD) data, search for all instances of a specific asteroid with the NeoWs lookup data  and be able to view Asteroids that have recently been closed to Earth with the NeoWs Feed data.
- The program must be able to display all of this data to the user.


### User Interaction
- The user will interact with the program with a flask GUI and the readme will provide all of the information that users need to install and use the program. The GUI will be easy to navigate for all users and include detailed explanations for what the data is and how to use it in specific pages of the website that you are guided to by link if the user is unsure on how to use the program or wants to understand the point of the program.




### Error Handling
- I will list the potential errors that users may run into and give them solutions in the readme file. The errors will be displayed in the terminal and on the website in a concise and clear way. The program will be reliable and shouldn't run into any errors that are not in the readme. I will ensure this by using extensive testing and debugging of all potential inputs.
### Non-functional Specifications
### Performance
- The system needs to be as efficient as possible, I'm aiming that all pages/program parts load under 5 seconds. Users want fast websites and we need to keep the GUI as fast as possible. We can ensure that the program remains fast by optimising our code and removing unnecessary parts.


### Useability / Accessibility
- The user interface is designed to be "idiot proof" and is relatively simple for anyone to operate. It will include information pages to explain how the API and program works and the program's purpose.
The README will be concise, clear and give users all the knowledge they need to use the program.




### Reliability
- API retrieval problems will be solved to the best of my ability. The data integrity is well maintained and is unlikely to fall in quality as it is maintained by a reputable government agency. Furthermore the program will be accurate and have proper error handling if the data is not returned correctly.
## Use Case
Actor: User


Preconditions: Internet access, Python installed, NASA API is available.
Main flow:
1. **Program beginning** - User downloads the program's requirements and follows the steps to run the program in the readme and opens the website
2.  **Information selection** -  User selects the type of API data they would like to view.
3. **Parameter selection** - The user selects/types in the parameter that would like to search the API dataset for.  
4. **Data Visualisation** System retrieves and displays the API data. Could display images, tables, graphs or text based on the selection.
5. **History update** Save the current user's history for display and fetching later.


Postconditions: API data is retrieved, the history of the current data is temporarily saved and the information is displayed to the user.
Postconditions: API data is selected and retrieved, and stored/removed successfully.

**Length and combination of characters can change.


*** In python a boolean is technically an Int. Furthermore, despite that a boolean should be 1 bit, most program languages treat it as 8 bits or a byte for consistency in the program. For the sake of simplicity for display it's going to be treated as a 4 long byte string and treated as a Bolean with 1 byte being the computation size as most programming languages treat it.

**** Shortened example

> **_NOTE:_**
The table includes both API parameters and API results and has some overlap between the two. There is also overlap with both the NeoWs and I will only do them once if they return them. The above statements describe some of the important information about the * content. Furthermore the Table content wraps and is laid out weirdly because of the amount of content when viewing the source code of the markdown file.

## Installation


#### README.md

# Software-Assessment-Task-1
### Data Science Assessment Task: Solar Sonar
## Objective
The objective of my program is to enable users to view NASA data, allowing easier access to space data and allowing space enthusiasts to interact with the wide variety of data supplied. My program allows users to see the Astronomy Picture of the day (APOD) and query Near Earth Object Web Service(NeoWs). The APOD is a fun snapshot that highlights the breathtaking astronomy photography of others which highlights an astronomical idea or event and it builds public interest in space. Neows gives real time extensive data about the hundreds of objects that wizz past our earth every week. The program aims to give users information about space and in particular asteroids. It caters to those with an interest in space and who are wanting to learn more.


## Features
- Users can request  Astronomy Picture of the day and Near Earth Object Web Service.
- Display NASA data with a combination of graphs, tables, text and images.
- Users are able to retrieve data that is displayed in a logical and simple way in the user interface.
- Users can see the history of the requests made with the program and can clear their history .
- The app allows users to look for specific data using an API.


## Requirements
To run this program you need the following python import libraries.
- Flask


Flask is a web framework that runs on python. It is powering the GUI in my project.
- Requests


Requests allows you to make HTTP requests to websites. I use it to fetch and retrieve my NASA data.
- Pandas


Pandas allows you to create, delete and edit data frames for data analysis and manipulation. Panda is used in my project to sort and edit the data.
- Datetime


A python library that allows you to work with date and time. Datetime is used to work with the date and time parameters that exist within my program.
- Matplotlib


A visualization python library that allows you to make graphs and other visualizations.  It's used to plot the graph that shows the asteroid count per day that is returned when fetching NeWs feed. The program is
- Pytz


A python library that allows you to receive different timezone information. Pytz is critical as it allows me to avoid errors by trying to access the NASA information before it is published.


** os isn't included as it comes preinstalled with python.


## How to use the program
1. Firstly if you are reading this on github you will need to open it in a suitable IDE with python 3.11 or higher installed.
2. Simply click the download button or alternatively use github desktop to open it.


3. Next navigate to python's terminal in your IDE and run the following command.

pip install -r requirements.txt

*Optional* If an upgrade pip prompt appears in your terminal, I heavily recommend you update it by copy and pasting the command there.


4. Click the run button in your preferred IDE (In App.py) and then give the program a second.


5. Follow the terminal instructions and open the link. (Shown below)


6. The program is running and you can navigate around the GUI. Infomation on how to understand the parameters and API responses are in the Help page. Further infomation about the diffrent NASA data and a reiteration of the programs focus are found on the About page.

7. Once you are finished click into the terminal and then press Ctrl+C at the same time and wait for the errors to stop. Once they finish the locally hosted website has closed. Please note that your history will be saved locally, if you want to clear it after the GUI you can simply delete history.txt's contents. However do not delete the file itself.

## Common Errors and Solutions
- Error: Can't select today in the date paramters for APOD or NeoWs?
    - Solution: The NASA dataset is updated by the american timezone date and therefore cannot display the data for the current date in places like Australia. The limitations on the date params  are set to the american timezone and are hardcoded in to prevent errors.
- Error: Reaches the API key's rate limit really quickly on the certain WIFI configurations (School WIFI).
    - Solution: Unfortunately I was unable to find one. I did implement a special error handling due to this issue by delaying until the API key can reassess. However sometimes you can get away with just breaking the current run instance by using CTR + C and then rerunning the program.
- Error: Selecting over 5 days will result in an error as the dataset breaks.
   - Solution: Keep NeWs feed under 5 days.
- Error: The NeoWS feed dataset breaks and returns nothing because in the parameters you put the end date before the start date.
   - Solution: Don't. Seriously, what did you think was going to happen?
- Error: The program returned the error page with the message. "Failed to fetch {{Type}}. The server responded with the status code of {{error_code}}."
    - Solution: Google the status code to understand the issue and  then check the terminal to see if the API key has reached the limit. Also check that all of the NASA API's  are functional and that your internet connection is functioning as expected.

### Commit History
<video width="1000" controls>
  <source src="Commit_History.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

I used git to add infomation to one or two of my commits however it changed all of the commit history to be the date of last push. The above video shows the commit history with the old dates as github desktop has it for some reason.

### Peer reviews:
Peer review 1: Max

4/5

- Nice data in tables and graphs integrated into the website!
- It has comprehensive help and about pages for beginner users to understand how it works, could have been improved through showing help next to the data so you don't have to pull up 2 windows side-by-side to look up what the data means.
- It has a history for when you want to revisit previous data, but could have been improved by storing the entire request data so you can simulate a web request without having wifi to see all the graphs and charts in detail.
- Very detailed instructions on how to use the program for anyone to run it, even with a section on common errors!

Peer review 2 Will:

4.5/5

The program respons to errors in a consise and meaningful fasion allowing for users to understand where the error occured. The program has a very aesthetic and intuitive GUI that is easy to use. The program also records  all API uses to refer to at a later time which is extremely useful. The readme and infomation on the website is great making it easy to use for all users.

# Maintenance
### Explain how you would handle issues caused by changes to the API over time.




I would handle changes to the NASA API overtime by adapting my program and then updating the program on github with a new version and list the fixed bug changes in the version description. As I do not have control of other programs, I cannot use the standard implementation systems and must wait for them to update their version when the issue arises.


### Explain how you would ensure the program remains compatible with new versions of Python and libraries like requests and matplotlib.




The program deliberately uses features of the libraries that aren't going to be depreciated in the near future and are unlikely to be changed. If the issues were changed, I would either update the code and change the library function to a modern equivalent or change the requirements.txt import to be a specific version of the library.




### Describe the steps you would take to fix a bug found in the program after deployment.




I would first recreate the steps of the bug found and then look through the terminal. Next I would bug fix the program by using a mixture of unit and function testing and print statements to print each part of the code. I would then find a solution and confirm proper functionality of the program before commiting to github.
Finally, on github I would publish a new version and list the fixed bug changes in the version description. As I do not have control of other programs, I cannot use the standard implementation systems and must wait for them to update their version when the issue arises.


### Outline how you would maintain clear documentation and ensure the program remains easy to update in the future.


The documentation will be kept simple with step by step explanations and the in depth explanations evident on the website to guide new users. I would avoid maintenance heavy features and would update the program. By using proper coding practices I would continue to code in app functions which ensures readability and keeps the code clean. I would use peer testing to maintain clear documentation and make sure that all explanations make sense to my target audience. The above steps is how I would clearly ensure that my documentation is concise and clear and that the program remains easy to update in the future.


### Final Evaluation
### Evaluate the current functionality of the program in terms of how well it addresses the functional and non-functional requirements.
The functionality of the program successfully addresses all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements and completes them all to a high degree. My project can successfully fetch and sort the API data from APOD and NeoWs. I make sure that users can easily visualize the API data in a clear way and clearly. My GUI is intuitive to navigate and usually loads all of the pages in under 5 seconds. The program successfully handles errors and prevents most user errors such as mispelling or incorrect use of capitals. I successfully keep my program reliable and accessible by having clear documentation on the website and readme files that allows users to understand how to use the API. My program works with a wide range of windows devices. It's clear that my project successfully completes all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements.




### Discuss areas for improvement or new features that could be added.


I could incorporate more NASA API features to allow my users to gain a deeper understanding about Space and planets. I would first incorporate DONKI (Space Weather) as I originally had this in my plans however I had to drop it due to logistical and time reasons. I would also add the satellite images of earth as it builds our understanding of the planet. Furthermore I would add an offline mode that would fix the API rate limit problems with the school wifi.


### Evaluate how the project was managed throughout its development and maintenance, including your time management and how challenges were addressed during the software development lifecycle.


The project was managed by clearly outlining the requirements. I also clearly stated my next steps in the development program and I made sure to stick as close as possible to my initial timeline.
I did lots of testing in this project by using print statements, using the flask debug terminal and simply running the program.I have faced a lot of bugs in this part of the program and I fixed them by incorporating the debugging strategies of function testing, debug statements and whole system testing. I also solved some of my problems with specific libraries/datasets with some help from the internet (mainly stack overflow).
