## Requirements
1. Functional Requirements (What the system should do)
Consider the following elements when developing your functional requirements. 

### Data Retrieval: What does the user need to be able to view in the system? 

User Requirements

What does the user need to be able to do? List all specifications here.
The user needs ot be able to acess a wide range of data

Inputs & Outputs

What inputs will the system need to accept and what outputs will it need to display?

Core Features

At its core, what specifically does the program need to be able to do?

User Interaction

How will users interact with the system (e.g. command-line, GUI?) and what information will it need to provide to help users navigate?

Error Handling

What possible errors could you face that need to be handled by the system?

2. Non-Functional Requirements (How the system should work)
Consider the following elements when developing your non-functional requirements:

Performance: How well does the system need to perform? 




Performance

How quickly should we try to get the system to perform tasks, what efficiency is required to maintain user engagement? How can we ensure our program remains efficient?

Useability / Accessibility

How might you make your application more accessible? What could you do with the User Interface to improve usability?

Reliability

What could perhaps not crash the whole system, but could be an issue and needs to be addressed? Data integrity? Duplicate data? API retrieval crash?

Reliability: How reliable does the system and data need to be?

Usability and Accessibility: How easy to navigate does the system need to be? What instructions will we need for users to access the system?
