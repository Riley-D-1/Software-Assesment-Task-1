## How to use the program
1. Firstly if you are reading this on github you will need to open it in a suitable IDE with python 3.11 or higher installed.
2. Simply click the download button or alternatively use github desktop to open it.


3. Next navigate to python's teriminal and run the following command. 
``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*Optional* If an upgrade pip prompt appears in your terminal, I heavily reccomend you update it by copy and pasting the command there. 
4. Click the run button in your preferred IDE (In App.py) and then give the program a second.
5. Follow the terminal instructions and open the link. (Shown below)
6. The program is running and you can navigate around the GUI.
7. Once you are finished click into the terminal and then press Ctr+C at the same time and wait for the errors to stop. Once they finish the locally hosted website has closed.
